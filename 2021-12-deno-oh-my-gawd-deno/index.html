_things turning me on this week_ <br/>
_☕enjoy with a hot cupa java/script_ <br/>
JavaScript is _mental_ now with `deno` --- forget `node` `npm` `package.json` `node_modules` and everything you growed up on.  This 🦕 changes _everything!_

About a year ago, an amazing coworker who shall remain anonymous ([COUGH] Drini), casually mentioned ["Deno"](https://deno.land) in a team meeting (~12 of us), mentioning Ryan Dahl, creator of `node` created this as The Next Thing.  I'd never heard of it, checked it out, got excited and was... _delflated_ seeing _full urls_ in `import` statements (instead of relative urls) since that wasn't compatible with browsers.

When an tech idea & premise is _so good_ with a fatal flaw, I _tend_ to revisit periodically...

3 months ago, to my _amazement_ -- all the main browsers were totally loading full urls, eg:
```js
import $ from 'https://esm.sh/jquery'
```

"Cancel my appointments for the month!" --- I dove in _immediately_ to kick the tires on the back-end and see if _fully_ replacing `node` for `deno` in my work (mostly backend) main repository for TV, audio & video, containting 30,000+ JS lines, might work.

In under 3 months, the entire repository has been moved over.

Here's a nice browser example:

https://av.prod.archive.org/demo/deno.htm

Pay especially attention to the top and later `import` statements here.

You can load logical `npm` modules directly from the web (!) 😍

Omitting (just) the pie chart setup clutter (it's a lot of JSON config for the data -- you can [see the full source here](https://av.prod.archive.org/demo/deno.js)):

```js
import $ from 'https://esm.archive.org/jquery@^3.0.0'
import dayjs from 'https://esm.archive.org/dayjs'
import * as d3v7 from 'https://esm.archive.org/d3'

import { log } from '../js/util/log.js'

window.d3 = { version: '7.0.0', ...d3v7 }

$('body').append(`
  <style>.card { width: 40%; margin: 3%; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; }</style>
  <div id="x" class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h1>ðŸ˜„ bootstrap hai whirld ðŸ˜„</h1>
    no real idea why it's working to \`import\` with urls starting with 'https://' now!
    <p> working in (at least): chrome, safari, firefox, safari iOS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <p>.. that doesnt work in \`node\` for example.</p>
    <p>.. but natively works in \`deno\`!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h2>some dayjs stuff</h2>
    ${dayjs().format('dddd MMMM D, YYYY h:mma')}<br>
    ${dayjs().format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')}<br>
    ${dayjs().startOf('month').add(1, 'day').set('year', 2018)
    .format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')}<br>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h2>user privacy</h2>
    self-hosted
    <a href="https://esm.sh">esm.sh</a>
    -- at
    <a href="https://esm.archive.org">esm.archive.org</a>
    <pre>
import dayjs from 'https://esm.archive.org/dayjs'
import $ from 'https://esm.archive.org/jquery@^3.0.0'
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div id="pieChart"></div>
`)
$('#x h1').hide().fadeIn('slow')

async function dpie() {
  const d3pie = (await import('https://esm.archive.org/d3pie')).default

  const pie = new d3pie('pieChart', {
    ...
  })
}

void dpie()
```

Look how clean that is!

No need to `npm install` -- no need for `npm` or `node` whatsoever.

You can load JS from `npm` packages transpiled-on-the-fly to `import`-able JS via https://www.skypack.dev/, https://esm.sh (we host one of these on our archive.org site for user privacy), and more.

It's hard to fully articulate how weightless it feels to develop multiple repos, all without any kind of `npm install` or setup -- and just load JS files directly into the browser or backend.

You can now _make websites, blogs, and more_ entirely free, committed to and hosted at https://github.com or https://gitlab.com -- no backend needed.

Here's a fun example of charting Live Music concerts stored at https://archive.org that I live coded for
[Aaron Swartz Day 2021](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/asd-2021/)
where everything is hosted free at github:

[band recordings per year site](https://traceypooh.github.io/multi-line-chart/)

[band recordings per year source](https://github.com/traceypooh/multi-line-chart)

I'm shook!

(and won't go back)
