Visit:  poohBot.com   for maps, info, comments

You love climbing... You love (or will love) the East Bay!
We give you what you need. If you can do these rides -- you'll get through any day on The Ride in June!

These are hard but rewarding rides.
 
The math is simple: bike + hill = euphoria!

Ride 1 of 5: Mt. diablo Halfway                 (Sat Mar 21, 46mi)
Ride 2 of 5: "Oil, Sugar, Beef!"                (Sat Apr  4, 44mi)
Ride 3 of 5: Morgan Territory                   (Sat Apr 11, 71mi)
Ride 4 of 5: Palomares Canyon                   (Sat May  9, 76mi)
Ride 5 of 5: Three Bears and Full Mt. Diablo    (Sat May 23, 73mi)
===================================================================

We bike Orinda north to the Carquinez Bridge through OIL refineries.  We head west by the C&H SUGAR plant.  We head south through COW COUNTRY around Martinez and Lafayette.  Finally, we recover as we trace back through the mostly flat canyons to Orinda BART.

There is one very challenging steep section of a hill that some riders may even consider walking their bikes for a bit.  Other that that, the views and variation in the terrain make this a particularly special and fun trip.

We want all riders to be comfortable with doing 60 mile challenging mountain rides as a prerequisite.

===================================================================

This ride is *EPIC* in both scale and beauty.  It is our favorite East Bay ride!
We head east through the valleys of the East Bay and circle around the backside of Mt. Diablo through some amazingly remote and beautiful countryside.  It features a nearly 2000 foot summit and a very long, beautiful, and steep-at-parts descent into Livermore/Danville.  We return back through the valleys in awe.

This goes through very remote and gorgeous terrain.  We will want riders to try to stay in pairs (or more) around the backside of Mt. Diablo portion.  You will need a large supply of food on you!  There are water and bathroom stops along the way, but there is a roughly 20 mile section with no other food options/services aside from park bathrooms and fountains.

If you make one East Bay ride this year, come out for this one.

===================================================================

We tour the East Bay flat valleys through Lafayette to Danville, with a stop for food at Cafe Francaise.
We continue through to the pretty railroad countryside of Sunol.
We then do our long climb through rural Palomares Canyon.  This is a remote and sheltered canyon backdrop and very pretty.  Arriving in Castro Valley, we move north through the parks on the Redwood Rd. hills back to Moraga.
We then do the short final hop back to Orinda.

===================================================================

We "warm up" with the 22 mile "Three Bears" infamous  (but doable by now) loop.

We then head east through the flat canyons and do nearly *4000* feet of climbing up Mt. Diablo to the amazing summit!  (Riders will have an option to do 1/2 the Diablo climb, to the ranger station, since the top part leaves and returns from the ranger station).

Mt. Diablo is of a legendary status in ancient folklore.  It also is home to some flowers that grow nowhere else in the world.  We have seen coyotes, eagles, foxes, snakes, deer, and even a tarantula (!) on our prior trips up and down the summit.  The South Gate bottom half climb was recently repaved and regraded so it makes for a nice and constant uphill climb to get into your "zone" while the warm sun shines on your back.  This is the biggest peak in the Bay Area, and makes for a suitable final weekend challenging and rewarding ride just before the Big Ride in June!
