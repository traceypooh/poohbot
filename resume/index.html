          <h2>Lead Engineer for website and TV, storage engineer, archivist</h2>
          <b><a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a></b>, San Francisco, CA<br/>
          October 2004 - Present<br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented <b>"full stack" for TV</b>
              -- recording and storing 70 worldwide channels (ATSC terrestrial and DVB-S satellite) simultaneously 24x7.
              Implemented entire UI/UX on top (2 full versions)
              <b><a href="https://archive.org/tv">https://archive.org/tv</a></b>.</li>
            <li>Built closed-captioning based search engine system (using SOLR).</li>
            <li><b>Completely converted entire <a href="https://archive.org">https://archive.org</a></b>
              website from designed-12-years-ago ancient design to <b>modern, responsive design</b>
              based on bootstrap and LESS.
              Second hardest job I've ever done -- 6 months of work plus 12 months of "political" work.</li>
            <li>Lead engineer on the "petabox" data storage system for archiving and serving
              digital books, video, and audio forever.</li>
            <li>Completely overhauled "version 0.1" system to "version 1.0".
              Converted perl to PHP5 with autoincludes and common classes.
              Wrote multiprocess, realtime, 24x7 item management system (called the "catalogd")
              in PHP5 to upload/modify/maintain over 20 million digital books, movies, audio, and otherwise.
              We add over 10TB of new content with over 100,000 "modification tasks" daily.</li>
            <li>Streamlined, maintained, and updated the main website,
              <a href="https://archive.org">https://archive.org</a></li>
            <li>Implemented and maintained SOLR search engine.  Helped migrate to ElasticSearch.</li>
            <li>DBA for MySQL.  Did 50%+ of the work to migrate to PostgreSQL and (mostly) handoff.</li>
            <li>Built a "Metadata API" system.</li>
            <li>Brought h.264 video inside flash-plugin as well as HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag video and audio technology to website.
              Revamped and updated back end "deriver" system to convert all modern audio
              and video to "user accessible" MP3 and (h.264) MPEG-4 formats that play inline
              in the browser and all devices.
              Added ability to play clip portions of video as well as jump into
              any startpoint (efficiently on-demand).</li>
            <li>Large scale work updating our over 1000 servers managment and configuration
              -- coolest feature is we can now re/image a box to our standard OS and setup
              with the push of a web page button!</li>
          </ul>
