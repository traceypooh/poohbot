We switched up typical saturday Mt. Tam loop, with a fun ride up to and across Bolinas Ridge.
I made a fun 4min supercut of the day ðŸ˜»

Gorgeous early spring-like weather all day -- **perfect** bike weather inspiring the filmmaker :)

At the top of the main off-road climb, which had some challenging chunky rocks and slippery rocks/dirt.  Only two of us made it the whole way up -- your girl's a climber! ðŸ˜»

The redwood trails along the ridgeline are just **amazingly gorgeous**.

Looking over the open ridge portion, where Tomales Bay is ahead of us in a green canyon of hills.

Great food & **beer** at Splitrock Tap & Wheel (Fairfax) after the long adventure day.  Two of us cracked and/or bonked a bit -- so it was a good stretch challenge day.
